Practice of developing computer software in a way that guards against the accidental introduction of security vulnerabilities. It involves writing code in a high-level language that follows strict principles, with the goal of preventing potential vulnerabilities (which could expose data or cause harm within a targeted system). Secure coding is more than just writing, compiling, and releasing code into applications. To fully embrace secure programming, you also need to create a secure development environment built on a reliable and secure IT infrastructure using secure hardware, software, and services and providers.

Secure coding is essential as software vulnerabilities are unfortunately an ever-present risk. For that reason, it's important to ensure that your code is secure and protected. Insecure code in important industries (e.g., finance, healthcare, energy, and transport) could result in financial and property damages, market manipulation and theft, even physical harm and fatalities. Therefore, ensuring secure coding practices must be a top priority for these organizations..

      <p><strong>“Automated Deployment”</strong> is a practice that allows you to ship code fully or semi-automatically across several stages of the development process - from initial development right through to production. It provides the ability to move your software between testing and production environments by using automated processes. This leads to repeatable and reliable deployments across the software delivery cycle. Deployment automation lets you release new features and applications more quickly and frequently, while removing the need for human intervention in application deployments.</p>

<p>Deployment automation is an important piece of enabling DevOps practices and managing a CI/CD pipeline. Continuous integration/continuous delivery (CI/CD) is a method to frequently deliver applications to customers and relies on ongoing automation and continuous monitoring throughout the lifecycle, from integration and testing phases to delivery and deployment. Continuous deployment (another possible definition for “CD”) can refer to using deployment automation to release a developer’s changes from the repository to production, where it is usable by customers. Because there is no manual deployment gate at this stage of the deployment pipeline before production, continuous deployment relies heavily on well-designed test automation.</p>

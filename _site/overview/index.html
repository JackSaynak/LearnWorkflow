      <p>DevSecOps, which stands for development, security, and operations, is a framework that integrates security into all phases of the software development lifecycle. Organizations adopt this approach to reduce the risk of releasing code with security vulnerabilities.</p>

<p>In traditional software development, projects are split into distinct phases for planning, design, development, integration, and testing, which happen sequentially over several months or even years. However, many organizations have found this approach to be too slow, making it difficult to meet customers expectations for continuous product improvements. Additionally, security typically gets bolted on at the very end, which puts companies at risk of a breach.</p>

<p>To remain competitive, many companies have adopted a DevOps model that prioritizes delivery of smaller packets of high-quality code rather than feature-rich projects that take longer. In this framework, software development and operations teams collaborate to incorporate testing and integration throughout the process.</p>

<p>DevSecOps is an enhancement to DevOps that builds security into all aspects of the process. The goal is to address security issues from the very start of the project. In this framework, not only does the entire team take responsibility for quality assurance and code integration but also security.</p>

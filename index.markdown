>"DevSecOps", short for "development, security, and operations", is a framework that integrates security into every step of the software development lifecycle. Organizations use this approach to mitigate the risk of releasing code with security vulnerabilities.

DevSecOps embeds security practices into the DevOps process. DevOps is a philosophy that integrates software development (Dev) and IT operations (Ops), with the goal of shortening the system development life cycle and providing continuous delivery of high-quality software. In contrast, DevSecOps takes this a step further by making everyone involved in a project responsible for security, ensuring that security considerations are addressed from the start rather than being added in at the end. This can lead to significant benefits, such as early identification of vulnerabilities in code, cost savings, and faster time to market.
